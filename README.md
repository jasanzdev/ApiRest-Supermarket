# üõí Supermarket Microservices API

A modern microservices-based REST API for managing supermarket operations.

## üìã Description

This project implements a distributed system using microservices architecture to handle supermarket operations. The system is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, separating concerns into independent services that follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and communicate through an API Gateway.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

### API Gateway
- Central entry point for all client requests
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization validation
- Rate limiting and caching
- Security and Headers
- Error Handling
- Performance Monitoring

### Microservices
1. **Authentication Service**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - User session management
   - JWT token management
   - Security policies

2. **Products Service**
   - Product catalog management
   - Inventory control
   - Category handling
   - Price management
   - Stock updates

3. **Users Service**
   - User management
   - Customer information
   - Role management
   - Password management

4. **Order Processing Service**
   - Shopping cart management
   - Order creation and processing
   - Order status tracking
   - Purchase history

## üöÄ Features

- Distributed system architecture
- Service isolation and independence
- Scalable microservices
- Centralized authentication
- Inter-service communication
- Distributed data management
- Service monitoring and logging
