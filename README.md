An application built with **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, featuring an API Gateway implemented using **http-proxy-middleware** to route requests across microservices. Communication between services is handled via **Axios**. The current microservices include **Authentication**, **Products**, and **Users**, with **PostgreSQL** as the database. This project demonstrates a scalable microservices architecture for a supermarket system.

## Features üöÄ

- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for routing requests using `http-proxy-middleware`.
- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - **Authentication Service**: Manages user login and registration using **JWT** for secure authentication üë§
  - **Products Service**: Handles product listings and inventory üõí
  - **Users Service**: Manages user profiles and data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
- **Communication**: Axios for inter-service communication üîó
- **Logging**: **Winston** for structured and centralized logging across services.
- **Authentication**: **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support additional microservices in the future.
- **Dockerized**: Containerized for easy deployment and development.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Node.js** & **Express.js**: Backend framework for building the API Gateway and microservices.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and enhances code quality.
- **http-proxy-middleware**: Used to implement the API Gateway for routing requests.
- **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests between microservices.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing application data.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Winston**: Logging library for structured and centralized logs.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and simplifying deployment.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-repositorio.git
   cd tu-repositorio

# API Gateway
GATEWAY_PORT=3000

# Authentication Service
AUTH_SERVICE_PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Products Service
PRODUCTS_SERVICE_PORT=4001

# Database (PostgreSQL)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=supermarket_db

Running with Docker üê≥
To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy
docker-compose build
Start the containers:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up
This will start the following services:

API Gateway on port 3000

Authentication Service on port 4000

Products Service on port 4001

PostgreSQL database

Stop the containers:

bash
Copy
docker-compose down

Logging with Winston üìù
The application uses Winston for structured logging. Logs are categorized by level (info, error, warn, etc.) and are stored in the logs/ directory. You can customize the logging configuration in the logger.ts file within each service.

Example log entry:

plaintext
Copy
2023-10-10T12:00:00.000Z [info]: User successfully authenticated
Authentication with JWT üîê
The Authentication Service uses JWT for secure user authentication. When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated and returned. This token must be included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

Example of a protected request:

bash
Copy
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" http://localhost:3000/api/protected-route
API Endpoints üåê
API Gateway
GET /products: Fetch all products.

POST /auth/register: Register a new user.

POST /auth/login: Log in and receive a JWT token.

Authentication Service
POST /register: Register a new user.

POST /login: Log in and receive a JWT token.

Products Service
GET /products: Fetch all products.

POST /products: Create a new product.

PATCH /products/:id : Update a product.

DELETE /products/:id : Delete a product.

Users Service
GET /users: Fetch all users.

GET /users/:id : Fetch a specific user by ID.

PATCH /users/:id : Update a user's profile.

DELETE /users/:id : Delete a user.
